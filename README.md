Exercises Ref : http://www.practicepython.org/exercise

exercise-1
==========
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 

exercise-2
==========
a) Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message. <br/>
b) Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

exercise 3
==========
a)Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5. <br/>
b) Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.<br/>
c) Write this in one line of Python.<br/>
d) Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.
